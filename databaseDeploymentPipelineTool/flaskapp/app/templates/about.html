                This Deployment Pipeline Dashboard is a intuitive interface designed and 
                developed by <strong>Shankara N G</strong> that allows teams to trigger, monitor, and manage
                automated deployments with respect to databases.
            </p>
            <p>
                It integrates with Git repositories to pull source code, build and deploy
                applications, and track the status of each pipeline stage in real-time.
                This Pipeline performs the following functions
                1. It can either run as a scheduled batch on the background or a manual trigger
                2. It will Either do a roll back of the previous deployment or deploy a new code
            </p>
            <p>
                Incase you choose deployment process
                1. In the case you are deploying a new code it will first take the back up of all the files
                2. It will check and create directories if required
                3. It will place the code files for the ETLS in the particular directories
                4. It will push all the sql scripts to it place and run the code
            </p>
            <p>

                2. It will check and create directories if required
                3. It will replace the code files for the ETLS in the particular directories with 
                old ones taken from backup
                4. It will push all the roll back sql scripts to it place and run the code and this is pulled from git

                The system is designed for simplicity and visibility providing engineers
                with a streamlined experience to initiate new deployments, monitor

                Technologies used include Flask, Python, Pandas, File Reader, Oracle SQL Client and
                for backend routing, HTML/CSS for frontend design, and a combination of CI/CD scripting tools to perform
                deployment operations on configured servers.
            </p>

                The goal of this dashboard is to improve deployment efficiency,
                consistency, and transparency within development teams.
